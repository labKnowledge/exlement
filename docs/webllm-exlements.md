# ChatWebLLMComponent Documentation

## Overview

The ChatWebLLMComponent is a custom web component that implements a chat interface powered by WebLLM (Web-based Large Language Model). It allows users to interact with various AI models directly in the browser, without requiring server-side processing.

## Features

- In-browser AI model loading and execution
- Support for multiple AI models
- Real-time chat interface with markdown support
- File upload functionality for sending content to the AI
- Model selection dropdown
- Token usage and generation speed statistics

## Usage

To use the ChatWebLLMComponent in your HTML, first ensure you've included the component's JavaScript file, then add the following tag to your HTML:

<chat-webllm-component></chat-webllm-component>

## Attributes

The component supports the following attributes:

- `model`: (Optional) The initial AI model to load.
- `temperature`: (Optional) The temperature setting for the AI model. Default is 1.0.
- `top-p`: (Optional) The top-p setting for the AI model. Default is 1.

Example:

<chat-webllm-component model="Llama-2-7b-chat-hf-q4f32_1" temperature="0.7" top-p="0.9"></chat-webllm-component>

## Methods

The component doesn't expose public methods for external use. All functionality is handled internally.

## Events

The component doesn't emit custom events. It relies on internal event handling for user interactions.

## Styling

The component uses Shadow DOM for encapsulation. To customize the appearance, you would need to modify the internal CSS within the component's `render` method.

## Key Features Explained

1. **Model Initialization**:
   - The component initializes the selected AI model when the "Load Model" button is clicked.
   - It uses a Web Worker to handle model loading and inference, ensuring the main thread remains responsive.

2. **Chat Interface**:
   - Users can type messages in the editable area and send them by pressing Enter.
   - The component supports markdown formatting in both user and AI responses.

3. **File Upload**:
   - Users can upload text files (.txt, .md, .js, .html, .css, .json) to insert content into the chat.

4. **Model Selection**:
   - A dropdown menu allows users to switch between different AI models.

5. **Markdown Parsing**:
   - The component parses markdown in messages, supporting code blocks, lists, bold, italic, and more.

6. **Code Copying**:
   - Code blocks in AI responses include a "Copy" button for easy copying.

7. **Usage Statistics**:
   - The component displays token usage and generation speed after each AI response.

## Limitations and Considerations

- The component requires modern browser features and may not work in older browsers.
- Large AI models may take significant time to load and could consume substantial memory.
- The component doesn't persist chat history or model state between page reloads.

## Browser Compatibility

This component should work in modern browsers that support Web Components, ES6+ features, and Web Workers. It has not been tested for backwards compatibility with older browsers.

## Dependencies

The component relies on the `@mlc-ai/web-llm` package, which is loaded from an external CDN.

## Performance

Performance may vary depending on the user's device capabilities and the size of the chosen AI model. The use of Web Workers helps maintain UI responsiveness during model operations.
